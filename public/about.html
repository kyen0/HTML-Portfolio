<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Cesar Ramos. I am a 28 year old beginner web developer in training. Previously, I owned a small flooring company
  which has been my full time job for 10+ years. Similar to web development, I enjoyed the task of learning new things constantly and expanding
  my knowledge on how to attempt to conquer tasks in a variety of methods. My passions outside of work include videography, vidoe games, and
  general automotive mechanics. My drive to enter a new work force is incalculable. Learning and understanding the intricacies of web development
  has peaked my curiosity and excitement for my potential future in the field. Please feel free to browse through the links and contact me with
  any questions or comments. Thank you!
